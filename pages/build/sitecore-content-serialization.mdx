# Sitecore Content Serialization (SCS)

Sitecore content serialization is the process of exporting content items and their associated media, templates, layouts, and other site-related information from a Sitecore instance to a serialized
format that can be easily transported and imported into another Sitecore instance. It is often used in development and deployment workflows to move content between different environments, such as from
a local development environment to a testing or production environment. The serialization format is typically YML, and there are several serialization tools available in Sitecore.
 third-party tools like Unicorn and TDS.

Starting with Sitecore 10.0 initial, Sitecore introduced their own version called Sitecore Content Serialization

`dotnet sitecore login --authority https://<sitecore-identity-server> --cm https://<sitecore-instance> --allow-write true`

`dotnet sitecore login --authority https://id.xmnextjs.localhost --cm https://cm.xmnextjs.localhost --allow-write true`

## Serialize content from the Sitecore database
`dotnet sitecore ser pull`

noticed that SCS created yml files which represents each item in the Sitecore database. This is what should be checked in.
