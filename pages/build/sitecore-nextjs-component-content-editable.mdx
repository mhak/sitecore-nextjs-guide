# Make your Next.js component content-editable
We'll delve into the process of making your Sitecore component content-editable in a Next.js environment. This can be achieved by leveraging the SitecoreContext object, which can be accessed using the `useSitecoreContext` hook.

The approach we'll be taking is accessing the fields of the current Sitecore item accessed by the route. If you are familiar with traditional Sitecore approach, it will be akin to accessing the fields of the `Sitecore.Context.Item` but done in a headless, Next.js way.

## Create a Sitecore template
In the Content Editor,

1. Navigate to /sitecore/templates/Feature
1. Create a Template Folder named "Article"
    1. Under Feature, right click, Insert > Template Folder
1. Create a template under that also named "Article"
    1. right click, Insert > Template
1. Add a new section named "Article"
1. Add fields
    1. Add a field named "Title" and type as Single-Line Text
    1. Add a field named "Body" and type as Rich Text

![Article Template](../../public/images/sitecore/article-template.png)

## Update the home template
We will utilize Sitecore's template inheritance to bring in fields from the template was just created onto the template used by the home page.
1. Navigate to /sitecore/templates/Project/xmnextjs/App Route
1. Click Content
1. Navigate to the "Article" template we created, and double click to select
1. Save
![Template Inheritance](../../public/images/sitecore/template-inheritance.png)
1. Navigate to the home item and enter some data.
![Update fields on the home page](../../public/images/sitecore/home-update-fields.png)
1. Publish all your changes

## Verify the home route data
To verify data about our home page, we will look at the data returned by the Sitecore Layout Service. This will be populated into the SitecoreContext object and is accessible by `useSitecoreContext` hook in Next.js.
1. In Visual Studio Code, look in `src/rendering/scjssconfig.json` and copy the apiKey value.
1. In a browser, open `https://cm.xmnextjs.localhost/sitecore/api/layout/render/jss?item=/&sc_apikey={YOUR API KEY}&sc_mode=normal`
1. You should see something like below. If not, ensure you've published all items in Sitecore.

```json {8-13}
"route": {
    "name": "home",
    "displayName": "home",
    "fields": {
        "pageTitle": {
            "value": "Welcome to Sitecore JSS"
        },
        "Title": {
            "value": "My first article"
        },
        "Body": {
            "value": "This is my first article"
        }
    },
}
```
## Update component
In Visual Studio Code, update your component. The first 3 imports from `@sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-nextjs` are fields and field types to help render data from Sitecore.
The last import is to the `useSitecoreContext` hook which gives access to the data populated into the SitecoreContext object which corresponds to the data returned by the [Sitecore Layout Service for the route](#verify-the-home-route-data).

We will declare a type which maps properties to the field names defined in the Sitecore template. Your property names should match the field names defined in the Sitecore template.

We will then get the data from the sitecoreContext, map it to the fields, and return the JSX rendering.

```tsx filename="article.tsx" showLineNumbers
import {
    Text,
    Field,
    RichText,
    useSitecoreContext
} from '@sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-nextjs';

type ArticleFields = {
    Title: Field<string>;
    Body: Field<string>,
};

const Article = (): JSX.Element => {
    const { sitecoreContext } = useSitecoreContext();
    const fields = sitecoreContext.route?.fields as ArticleFields;

    return (
        <section>
            <Text tag="h1" field={fields.Title} />
            <RichText field={fields.Body} />
        </section>
    )
};

export default Article
```
