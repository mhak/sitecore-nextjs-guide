# Introduction
 
Welcome to a beginner's guide to developing with Sitecore Next.js. This guide is designed to be a starting point for developers who are new to building Sitecore solutions in a headless,
Next.js environment.

Transitioning from a monolithic architecture to a composable one can seem overwhelming, which is why this guide breaks the process down into easy-to-understand pieces.
It provides step-by-step instructions on setting up a local environment and creating components. This guide would not go into depth on every topic; it is intended for the audience
to conduct further research on their own.

You will learn:
1. Brief overview of headless architecture
1. How to setup a local docker instance running Sitecore XM
1. Beginner Sitecore concepts
1. Creating components using Next.js

If you're a traditional Sitecore MVC developer or a front-end developer starting on a headless Sitecore Next.js solution, then this guide is perfect for you.

## Getting started

If you do not have an Sitecore environment, start at [prerequisites](/environment/prerequisites).  
If you already have one, feel free to skip to [create your first component](/create-your-first-component/create-a-component).
