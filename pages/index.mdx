# Introduction
 
Welcome to a beginners guide to Sitecore Next.js. This guide aims to be a starting point for developers new to developing Sitecore in a headless, Next.js environment.
If you are traditionally a Sitecore MVC developer or you are a front end developer starting on a headless Sitecore, Next.js solution then this guide is for you.


## Getting started

If you do not have an Sitecore environment, start at [prerequisites](/environment/prerequisites).  
If you already have one, feel free to skip to [create your first component](/create-your-first-component).
